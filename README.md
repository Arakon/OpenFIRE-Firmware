# SAMCO Enhanced+ - Arduino Powered Light Gun (now with added pew-pews!)
##### Alt working title: GUN4ALL

Based on the [Prow Enhanced fork](https://github.com/Prow7/ir-light-gun), which in itself is based on the 4IR Beta "Big Code Update" [SAMCO project](https://github.com/samuelballantyne/IR-Light-Gun)

## PLUS Enhancements!
- **Solenoid Support!** Get the authentic arcade feedback with every shot, in either single shot, three-shot burst, or rapid fire modes. Intelligently works when aiming *on-screen!*
- **Rumble Support!** Feel the subtle feedback of a motor, for those moments when you need to *shoot outside of the screen!*
- **Temperature Sensor Support!** With an optional TMP36 sensor, you can keep your solenoid working better for longer! Tempers feedback based on temperature readings with every shot.
- **Offscreen Button Support!** An optional setting for older games, the gun will send a different button input (right click) when shooting off-screen if enabled!
- **Toggleable Extras!** Aside from the option for using hardware switches baked in, the extras can all be individually toggled mid-game in pause mode (Button C + Select)!
- **Dual Core Support!** If using a board powered by the RP2040, it will take advantage of that second core for processing button inputs in parallel, (theoretically) reducing latency!
- **MAMEHooker Support! (INCREDIBLY WIP)** {insert blurb here about furthering my own goals or smth}
- Fixed button responsiveness; no sticky inputs, and solid debouncing with no performance impact!
- All upgrades are *optional,* and can work as a drop-in replacement for current SAMCO builds (with minor changes).
- Plenty of safety checks, to ensure rock-solid functionality without parts sticking or overheating. Now you too can feel like a helicopter parent!
- Remains forever open source, with *compatibility for GUN4IR parts!* Can use the same community resources of parts and tutorials for easier assembly of a complete build.
- Clearer labeling in the sketch for user readability, to streamline configuration as much as possible!
- Fully cross-platform solution, all initial hardware configuration done using the open-source Arduino IDE and profiles are saved on the board!
- Made out of at least 49% passion and 49% stubbornness (and 2% friendly spite)!

## Original Prow's Fork Enhancements
- Increased precision for maths and mouse pointer position
- Glitch-free DFRobot positioning (DFRobotIRPositionEx library)
- IR camera sensitivity adjustment (DFRobotIRPositionEx library)
- Faster IIC clock option for IR camera (DFRobotIRPositionEx library)
- Optional averaging modes can be enabled to slightly reduce mouse position jitter
- Enhanced button debouncing and handling (LightgunButtons library)
- Modified AbsMouse to be a 5 button device (AbsMouse5 library)
- Multiple calibration profiles
- Save settings and calibration profiles to flash memory (SAMD) or EEPROM (RP2040)
- Built in Processing mode for use with the SAMCO Processing sketch

## Requirements
- Adafruit ItsyBitsy [M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3727), [M4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3800), or [RP2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4888) *(ATmega32U4 5V 16MHz or Pro Micro ATmega32U4 5V 16MHz don't have enough codespace or memory at this point.)*
  * Arduino SAMD21/51 boards & Raspberry Pi Pico *should* be compatible with minor modifications, but keep in mind the differences in pinouts! [See the SAMCO project for legacy build details.](https://github.com/samuelballantyne/IR-Light-Gun)
- DFRobot IR Positioning Camera SEN0158: [Mouser (US Distributor)](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/DFRobot/SEN0158?qs=lqAf%2FiVYw9hCccCG%2BpzjbQ%3D%3D) | [DF-Robot (International)](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1088.html)
- 4 IR LED emitters: regular Wii sensor bars might work for small distances, but it's HIGHLY recommended to use [SFH 4547 LEDs](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/720-SFH4547) w/ 5.6Î© *(ohm)* resistors. [Build tutorial here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNoWT8CaGRc)
   * Optional: Any 12V solenoid, w/ associated relay board. [Build tutorial here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uWgqc8g1PM)
     * *Requires a DC power extension cable and a separate adjustable 12V power supply.*
   * Optional: Any 5V gamepad rumble motor, w/ associated relay board. [Build tutorial here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiJ5rE-MeHw)
   * Optional: Any 2-way SPDT switches, to adjust state of rumble/solenoid/rapid fire in hardware (can be adjusted in software from pause mode if not available!)

The RP2040 is the most performant board for the cheapest price, and future proofs builds significantly, but the M0 and M4 should still work well! ATmega-based boards could work, but are out of code space with all the libraries being used, and may have performance problems.

## Additional information
[Check out the enclosed instruction book!](SamcoEnhanced/README.md) Also see the README files in `libraries` for more information on library functionality.

For reference, the default schematic and (general) layout for the build and its optional extras are attached:
![Weh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeongGino/ir-light-gun-plus/plus/SamcoPlus%20Schematic.png)
 * *Clarification: Rumble power can go to either the pin marked `VHi` (board decides power delivery) or `USB` (directly powered from the USB interface).*

## Known Issues (want to fix sooner rather than later):
- Temperature sensor *should* work, but haven't tested yet; there be ~~[elf goddesses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgw9RKpaKY)~~ dargons.

***NOTE:*** Solenoid *may or may not* cause EMI disconnects depending on the build, the input voltage, and the disarray of wiring in tight gun builds. **This is not caused by the sketch,** but something that theoretically applies to most custom gun builds (just happened to happen to me and didn't find many consistent search results involving this, so be forewarned!) ***Make sure you use thick enough wiring!*** I replaced my jumper cables with 18AWG wires, as well as reduced freely floating ground daisy chain clumps, and my build seems to hold up to sustained solenoid use now.

## TODO (can and will implement, just not now):
- Finish MAMEHooker support.
  * If someone could help me get this working and provide the needed INIs so I could make this easier for the rest of the community, *please* get in touch!
  * So far we only support S (start, ignoring the bit), E (end), M1x3 (offscreen mode - offscreen button mode only), F0 (solenoid feedback w/ auto) and F1 (rumble feedback w/ pulse)
  * Want to implement F2/3/4 (R/G/B LED color and intensity) by using the onboard LED on supported Adafruit boards, maybe external NeoPixels in the future.
  * How many of the other modes do we need? What about the padding bits, are those only x's or should they be periods?
  * How long should a rumble "pulse" actually be?
- Should implement support for rumble as an alternative force-feedback system (`RUMBLE_FF`); able to do so now, just have to do it.
- Code is still kind of a mess, so I should clean things up at some point maybe kinda.

## Wishlist (things I want to but don't know how/can't do yet):
- Console support? [It's definitely possible!](https://github.com/88hcsif/IR-Light-Gun)
- Document and implement separate RGB LED support?
  * We currently use only a board's builtin DotStar or NeoPixel, but this is only for distinguishing between profiles and indicating camera state for now. Could make RGB LEDs react to events, i.e. trigger pulls.
  * Would be easier to use external NeoPixels since we're running out of available pins, but generic four-pin RGB leds would be nice too.
- RP2040 has dual core support, currently handles input polling in parallel; any other boards that have dual cores?
  * ESP boards seem to have some support, but they're much more a pain in the butt to implement than the simple setup1()/loop1() the RP2040 needs.
- Could the tracking be improved more? We have a slight but still somewhat noticeable amount of cursor drift when aiming from extreme angles at screen corners on a 50" display with fisheye lenses.
- *Maybe* make an option for a true autofire that auto-reloads after a set amount of seconds or trigger pulls? Make the coordinates move to 0,0 and force a mouse unclick/click/unclick. Might be cheaty, but if someone wants it...
  * A lot of games have problems with this, though. Not sure if that's desirable with the implied caveats.

* Prow7, for improving an already promising project and providing the basis for this madness.
* Jaybee, for a frame of reference on implementing the feedback additions, and to hopefully act as an OS-agnostic competition for the (I assume) great GUN4IR.
* [My YouTube audience,](https://youtube.com/@ThatOneSeong) for their endless patience as I couldn't help but work on this instead of videos.
* Emm, for being there when I needed her.
