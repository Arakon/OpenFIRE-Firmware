# OpenFIRE - The Open *Four Infa-Red Emitter* Light Gun System

Forked from [GUN4ALL](http://github.com/SeongGino/ir-light-gun-plus), which is based on the [Prow Enhanced fork](https://github.com/Prow7/ir-light-gun), which in itself is based on the 4IR Beta "Big Code Update" [SAMCO project](https://github.com/samuelballantyne/IR-Light-Gun)

## Features:
- **Fully featured peripherals:** Solenoid & Rumble Force Feedback, TMP36 Temperature Monitoring, and others to come.
- **Flexible Input System** with outputs to Keyboard, 5-button ABS Mouse, and dual-stick gamepad w/ d-pad support.
- **Easy installation:** Simple *.UF2* binaries that can be drag'n'dropped directly onto an *RP2040*-based Microcontroller.
- **Portable on-board settings** (using an emulated EEPROM) to store calibration profiles, toggles, settings, mappings (WIP), identifier and more to come.
- **Integrates with the [OpenFIRE App](https://github.com/TeamOpenFIRE/OpenFIRE-App)** for user-friendly, and cross-platform configuration.
- **Optimized for the RP2040**, using a second core for input reading and serial handling.
- **Compatible with PC Force Feedback handlers** such as [Mame Hooker](https://dragonking.arcadecontrols.com/static.php?page=aboutmamehooker) and [QMamehook](https://github.com/SeongGino/QMamehook).
- **Forever free and open source to the lightgun community!**

## Requirements
- An Arduino-compatible microcontroller based on an **RP2040**.
  * Recommended boards for new builds would be the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) *(cheapest, most pins available),* Adafruit [Kee Boar KB2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5302) *(cheaper, Pro Micro formfactor, compatible with [GUN4IR boards](https://www.gun4ir.com/products/universal-gun4ir-diy-pcb)),* or [ItsyBitsy RP2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4888) *(compatible with [SAMCO boards](https://www.ebay.com/itm/184699412596))*
  * Keep in mind the differences in pinouts, as it will always be different between builds and boards!
- **DFRobot IR Positioning Camera SEN0158:** [Mouser (US Distributor)](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/DFRobot/SEN0158?qs=lqAf%2FiVYw9hCccCG%2BpzjbQ%3D%3D) | [DF-Robot (International)](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1088.html) | [Mirrors list](https://octopart.com/sen0158-dfrobot-81833633)
- **4 IR LED emitters:** regular Wii sensor bars might work for small distances, but it's HIGHLY recommended to use [SFH 4547 LEDs](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/720-SFH4547) w/ 5.6Î© *(ohm)* resistors. [Build tutorial here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNoWT8CaGRc)
   * Optional: **Any 12/24V solenoid,** w/ associated relay board. [Build tutorial here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uWgqc8g1PM) [Easy driver board here](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/bjY4d7Vo)
     * *Requires a DC power extension cable &/or DC pigtail, and a separate adjustable 12-24V power supply.*
   * Optional: **Any 5V gamepad rumble motor,** w/ associated relay board. [Build tutorial here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiJ5rE-MeHw) [Easy driver board here](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/VdsmUaSm)
   * Optional: **Any 2-way SPDT switches,** to adjust state of rumble/solenoid/rapid fire in hardware *(can be adjusted in software from pause mode if not available!)*
 
## Installation:
Grab the latest *.UF2* binary for your board from the releases page (TODO), and drag'n'drop the file to your microcontroller while booted into Bootloader mode (RP2040 is automatically mounted like this when no program is loaded, or can be forced into this mode by holding BOOTSEL while plugging it into the computer - it will appear as a removable storage device called **RPI-RP2**).

## Additional information
[Check out the enclosed instruction book!](SamcoEnhanced/README.md) Also see the README files in `libraries` for more information on library functionality.

For reference, the default schematic and (general) layout for the build and its optional extras are attached.

 * *Layouts can be customized after installing the firmware - the only pins that **must** match are Camera Data & Clock.*

## Known Issues (want to fix sooner rather than later):
- Calibrating while serial activity is ongoing has a chance of causing the gun to lock up (exact cause still being investigated).
- Camera failing initialization will cause the board to lock itself in a "Device not available" loop.
  * Add extra feedback in the initial docking message for the GUI to alert the user of the camera not working?

> [!NOTE]
> Solenoid *may or may not* cause EMI disconnects with too thin of wiring. Cables for this run specifically should be **22AWG** at its thinnest - or else the cables will become antennas under extended use, which will trip USB safety thresholds in your PC to protect the ports.

## TODO:
- (Re-)expose button function remapping.
- Should implement support for rumble as an alternative force-feedback system (currently under `RUMBLE_FF` define, but should be a normal toggleable option).

## Thanks:
* Samuel Ballantyne, for his SAMCO project which inspired this madness in the first place.
* Prow7, for improving an already promising project and providing the basis for this madness.
* The testers that have had to deal with Seong's MAMEHOOKER integration stability antics.
